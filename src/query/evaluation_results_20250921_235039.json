      "question": "Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",
      "expected_answer": "No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year.",
      "actual_answer": "I'll analyze Adobe's operating margin profile through FY2022 to determine if it's improving and assess whether operating margin is a useful metric for Adobe. Now I'll search for operating income and revenue data in Adobe's recent financial statements to calculate operating margins. Let me search more broadly for income statement data in Adobe's 2022 10-K: Let me search for the financial statements section around page 52: Let me search for specific revenue amounts and financial data: Let me read a larger section of the Adobe 2022 10-K to find the financial statements: Great! I found some financial data. Let me continue reading to find the complete income statement with operating income: Let me continue reading to find the complete income statement with operating income: Perfect! Now I can see the financial data. Let me calculate the operating income and margin. Let me also check for prior years to compare the trend: Based on the data I've found, I can calculate Adobe's operating margins. From the financial data:\n\n**FY2022:**\n- Revenue: $17,606 million\n- Cost of revenue: $2,165 million  \n- Operating expenses: $9,343 million\n- Operating income: $17,606 - $2,165 - $9,343 = $6,098 million\n- Operating margin: $6,098 ÷ $17,606 = 34.65%\n\n**FY2021:**\n- Revenue: $15,785 million\n- Cost of revenue: $1,865 million\n- Operating expenses: $8,118 million  \n- Operating income: $15,785 - $1,865 - $8,118 = $5,802 million\n- Operating margin: $5,802 ÷ $15,785 = 36.75%\n\n**FY2020:**\n- Revenue: $12,868 million\n- Cost of revenue: $1,722 million\n- Operating expenses: $6,909 million\n- Operating income: $12,868 - $1,722 - $6,909 = $4,237 million  \n- Operating margin: $4,237 ÷ $12,868 = 32.93%\n\nLet me also check Adobe's 2021 and prior years for additional trend data: Now let me search for the operating expenses in 2021 to confirm the operating margin calculation: Let me search more directly for the complete operating expenses breakdown in 2021: Let me read more of the 2021 file to find the operating expenses breakdown: Perfect! Now I have all the operating expense data for 2021. Let me also check 2020 to get a complete picture: Now I have sufficient data to answer the question. Based on my analysis of Adobe's financial statements from FY2020-FY2022:\n\n**ANSWER: No - Adobe does not have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022**\n\n**OPERATING MARGIN TREND ANALYSIS:**\n- FY2020: 32.93% operating margin ($4,237M ÷ $12,868M)  \n- FY2021: 36.75% operating margin ($5,802M ÷ $15,785M)\n- FY2022: 34.65% operating margin ($6,098M ÷ $17,606M)\n\n**TREND DIRECTION:** Declining from FY2021 to FY2022\n- FY2021 to FY2022: Operating margin decreased by 2.10 percentage points (from 36.75% to 34.65%)\n- Despite strong revenue growth of 12% ($15,785M to $17,606M), operating expenses grew faster at 15% ($8,118M to $9,343M)\n\n**OPERATING MARGIN IS A USEFUL METRIC FOR ADOBE:**\n\nOperating margin is highly relevant and useful for Adobe because:\n\n1. **Subscription Business Model**: Adobe's 93% subscription revenue makes operating margin a key indicator of operational efficiency and pricing power\n2. **High Fixed Costs**: With significant R&D (17% of revenue) and sales/marketing (28% of revenue) investments, operating leverage is critical\n3. **Scalability Assessment**: Operating margin shows how well Adobe converts revenue growth into profitability as it scales\n4. **Investment Efficiency**: Tracks how effectively Adobe's heavy investments in product development and customer acquisition translate to operating income\n\n**CONTEXT:**\nThe FY2022 margin decline was driven by:\n- 18% increase in R&D expenses ($2,540M to $2,987M) \n- 15% increase in sales/marketing expenses ($4,321M to $4,968M)\n- 16% increase in cost of revenue ($1,865M to $2,165M)\n\n**SOURCE:** ADOBE_2022_10K.md - Financial Performance Summary and Operating Expenses (Pages 40-45)",

        "reasoning": "The actual answer correctly identifies that Adobe's operating margin declined from FY2021 to FY2022 (36.75% to 34.65%, a 2.10 percentage point decrease), which matches the expected answer's finding of a decline from 36.8% to 34.6% (2.2% drop). The minor differences in calculated percentages (likely due to rounding differences in intermediate calculations) don't affect the core conclusion that Adobe does not have an improving operating margin profile."

Revenue recognition occurs over time as costs are incurred, making traditional gross margin analysis less meaningful.\n\n2. **Development Program Structure**: Boeing's \"cost of sales\" includes substantial R&D, development charges, and reach-forward losses on new programs (like 777X, KC-46A, VC-25B). These are period costs that distort traditional gross margin calculations.\n\n3. **Multi-Year Production Programs**: Aircraft programs span decades with front-loaded development costs and back-loaded profitability. A single year's gross margin doesn't reflect program economics.\n\n**More Relevant Metrics for Boeing:**\n- **Operating Margin**: Better reflects actual operational performance excluding development charges\n- **Program Profit Margins**: Track individual aircraft programs over their lifecycle  \n- **Cumulative Catch-up Adjustments**: Show how program estimates change over time\n- **Segment Operating Performance**: BCA, BDS, and BGS have different business models requiring separate analysis\n\n**2022 Context:**\nBoeing's 2022 results included $5.3 billion in unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments primarily from defense development programs, making gross margin analysis particularly misleading for assessing underlying business performance.

Based on my search of Boeing's 10-K filings for both years, I found the effective tax rate information. Let me provide the comparison:\n\n**ANSWER: Boeing's effective tax rate decreased significantly from 14.8% in FY2021 to -0.6% in FY2022**\n\nCOMPARISON ANALYSIS:\nFY2021: 14.8% effective tax rate\nFY2022: -0.6% effective tax rate\nChange: -15.4 percentage points (from a positive rate to a negative rate)\nTrend Direction: Declining substantially - moved from paying taxes to receiving a net tax benefit\n\nCONTEXT:\nThe dramatic shift from a 14.8% effective tax rate in 2021 to a negative 0.6% rate in 2022 reflects Boeing's continued financial challenges. Both years showed pre-tax losses, but the company had an income tax benefit of $743 million in 2021 versus an income tax expense of $31 million in 2022. The negative effective tax rate in 2022 indicates that Boeing's tax expense was minimal relative to its substantial pre-tax loss of $5.022 billion.\n\nKEY FACTORS:\n- FY2021: Loss before income taxes of $5.033 billion with income tax benefit of $743 million\n- FY2022: Loss before income taxes of $5.022 billion with income tax expense of $31 million\n- Boeing increased its valuation allowance significantly in 2022 ($1.199 billion impact vs $512 million in 2021), reducing the company's ability to recognize tax benefits\n\nSOURCE: BOEING_2022_10K.md - Income Tax reconciliation table (Page 77), BOEING_2021_10K.md - Income Tax reconciliation table (Page 85)",

Now let me analyze the data to understand the progression and calculate the expected acceleration. **ANSWER: No - J&J's adjusted EPS growth is expected to accelerate moderately in FY2023, not significantly**\n\n**GROWTH COMPARISON:**\nFY2021 to FY2022: 3.6% growth ($9.80 to $10.15)\nFY2022 to FY2023: 5.0-6.0% expected growth ($10.15 to $10.65-$10.75 midpoint)\n\n**FY2023 GUIDANCE PROGRESSION:**\n- **Initial Guidance (January 2023)**: $10.50 midpoint (3.5% growth)\n- **Updated Guidance (April 2023)**: $10.65 midpoint (5.0% growth)\n- **Final Guidance (July 2023)**: $10.75 midpoint (6.0% growth)\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nThe expected acceleration is moderate, from 3.6% in FY2022 to approximately 6.0% in FY2023. While this represents an improvement in growth rate, it's not a dramatic acceleration. The company progressively raised guidance throughout 2023, showing stronger-than-expected performance with Q2 2023 adjusted EPS growing 8.1% year-over-year.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n- FY2022 Adjusted EPS: $10.15\n- FY2023 Expected Adjusted EPS: $10.70-$10.80 range / $10.75 midpoint\n- Expected Growth Rate: 5.5%-6.5% / 6.0% midpoint\n\n**SOURCE**: JOHNSON_JOHNSON_2023Q2_EARNINGS.md - Full-Year 2023 Guidance (Page 5), JOHNSON_JOHNSON_2022Q4_EARNINGS.md - Full-Year 2022 Results (Page 1)",

I can see mentions of Adjusted EBITDAR but I need to find specifically \"Adjusted EBIT\" not \"Adjusted EBITDAR\". Let me search more specifically for this term and also look for interest expense data. Now let me look for Adjusted EBIT calculation in the 10-K document. Since I didn't find \"Adjusted EBIT\" specifically, let me search for reconciliation tables that might show how to derive it from Adjusted EBITDAR. Let me search for reconciliation tables to understand how Adjusted EBIT might be calculated from the data available. Now let me look for the actual reconciliation table that shows how Adjusted EBITDAR is calculated: Let me search for the reconciliation table more broadly: Perfect! I found the reconciliation table. Let me read the complete table to get the data needed: I need to see the complete Adjusted EBITDAR value. Let me continue reading: The table seems to be cut off. Let me search for the actual Adjusted EBITDAR value directly: Great! Now I have the key information. From the search results, I can see that MGM does not report \"Adjusted EBIT\" specifically - they only report \"Adjusted EBITDAR\". However, to calculate an interest coverage ratio using Adjusted EBIT, I would need to subtract depreciation, amortization, and rent from Adjusted EBITDAR.\n\nLet me find the specific numbers needed and mark my progress: Based on my analysis, I have found the key information. Let me now calculate the interest coverage ratio.\n\nFrom the data found:\n\n1. **Adjusted EBITDAR for FY2022**: $3,497,254 thousand (from both documents)\n2. **Interest Expense for FY2022**: $594,954 thousand (from multiple sources)\n\nHowever, the question asks for **Adjusted EBIT**, not Adjusted EBITDAR. From the reconciliation table, I can see that to get from Adjusted EBITDAR to Adjusted EBIT, I need to subtract:\n- Depreciation and amortization: $3,482,050 thousand  \n- Triple-net operating lease and ground lease rent expense: $1,950,566 thousand\n\nLet me calculate this: **ANSWER: MGM does not report \"Adjusted EBIT\" as a specific metric. They only report \"Adjusted EBITDAR.\"**\n\nHowever, I can derive an implied Adjusted EBIT calculation:\n\n**CALCULATION:**\n\nStarting point: Adjusted EBITDAR (FY2022): $3,497,254 thousand\n\nTo derive Adjusted EBIT, subtract:\n- Depreciation and amortization: $3,482,050 thousand\n- Rent expense (triple-net operating lease and ground lease): $1,950,566 thousand\n\n**Implied Adjusted EBIT = $3,497,254 - $3,482,050 - $1,950,566 = ($1,935,362) thousand**\n\nAnnual Interest Expense (FY2022): $594,954 thousand\n\n**Interest Coverage Ratio = ($1,935,362) ÷ $594,954 = (3.25)**\n\n**Note: This results in a negative coverage ratio because the implied Adjusted EBIT is negative after removing depreciation, amortization, and rent from Adjusted EBITDAR.**\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\nThe reconciliation table shows MGM's Operating Income for FY2022 was $1,439,372 thousand. After adjusting for the various items that comprise \"Adjusted\" metrics, the resulting figure becomes negative, indicating that MGM's core earnings before interest were insufficient to cover their rent and depreciation expenses in 2022.\n\n**SOURCE:** MGMRESORTS_2022_10K.md - Reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDAR (Page 45)",

However, working capital is not a meaningful or relevant metric for PayPal due to its unique business model.**\n\n**WORKING CAPITAL CALCULATION:**\n- Total Current Assets (FY2022): $57,517 million\n- Total Current Liabilities (FY2022): $45,101 million  \n- Working Capital = $57,517 - $45,101 = $12,416 million\n\n**WHY WORKING CAPITAL IS NOT RELEVANT FOR PAYPAL:**\n\nPayPal's business model fundamentally differs from traditional companies, making working capital analysis misleading:\n\n1. **Customer Fund Management**: $40.1 billion of current liabilities represents \"Funds payable and amounts due to customers\" - these are customer deposits PayPal holds as a payment processor, not traditional operational liabilities.\n\n2. **Matched Asset-Liability Structure**: PayPal maintains corresponding assets ($36.4 billion in \"Funds receivable and customer accounts\") to back customer deposits, as required by regulation. This creates an artificial inflation of both current assets and liabilities.\n\n3. **Payment Processing Business**: PayPal operates as a financial intermediary where customer funds flow through their balance sheet temporarily. These funds are not available for operations and must be held as liquid assets per regulatory requirements.\n\n4. **Non-Operating Nature**: The majority of PayPal's current assets and liabilities relate to customer fund custody rather than traditional business operations like inventory, accounts payable to suppliers, or trade receivables.\n\n**SOURCE:** PAYPAL_2022_10K.md - Consolidated Balance Sheets (Page 61)\n\nFor PayPal, metrics like transaction volume growth, take rates, and active user accounts are more meaningful indicators of financial health than traditional working capital analysis.",

As of the second quarter of 2023, approximately 90% of these separation costs had already been incurred since inception.\n\nBREAKDOWN:\n- Total expected separation costs: $700 million\n- Costs incurred through Q2 2023: ~$630 million (90% of $700M)\n- Remaining expected costs: ~$70 million (10% of $700M)\n\nCOST COMPONENTS:\nThese charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\n\nSOURCE: Pfizer_2023Q2_10Q.md - Legal Proceedings section (Page 1516)",

The $1 billion maximum consideration represents proceeds from selling assets rather than spinning off an operating business unit to shareholders.\n\nThe filing also references the completed 2020 Upjohn Business spin-off (combined with Mylan to form Viatris), but this was a historical transaction, not a current Q2 2023 activity.\n\nSOURCE: Pfizer_2023Q2_10Q.md - Our Business Development Initiatives (Page 8)",

      "question": "What drove the reduction in SG&A expense as a percent of net sales in FY2023?",

      "question": "Does Verizon have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.",
      "expected_answer": "No. The quick ratio was approximately 0.54 for Verizon. It indicated that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile.",
      "actual_answer": "I'll analyze Verizon's liquidity profile by calculating its quick ratio for FY 2022. Let me search for the relevant financial data. Now let me search more specifically for the balance sheet data to find the current assets and current liabilities: I need to find the actual balance sheet. Let me search more specifically: Great! I found the balance sheet. Now let me get the current liabilities section: Let me check if there are any marketable securities mentioned in the current assets: Now I have all the information needed to calculate the quick ratio. Based on the balance sheet data I found:\n\n**FY 2022 Balance Sheet Data (in millions):**\n\n**Current Assets:**\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $2,605\n- Accounts receivable, net: $24,506\n- Total current assets: $37,857\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\n- Total current liabilities: $50,171\n\nI did not find any marketable securities specifically listed in the current assets section. **ANSWER: No - Verizon does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022.**\n\nCALCULATION:\nStep 1: Extract quick ratio components from FY 2022 balance sheet\n  - Cash and cash equivalents: $2,605 million\n  - Accounts receivable, net: $24,506 million  \n  - Marketable securities: $0 million (none found in current assets)\n  - Current liabilities: $50,171 million\n\nStep 2: Apply quick ratio formula\n  - Formula: Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nStep 3: Calculate quick ratio\n  - Calculation: ($2,605 + $0 + $24,506) / $50,171 = $27,111 / $50,171 = 0.54\n\nResult: Quick ratio of 0.54\n\nASSESSMENT:\nQuick Ratio: 0.54 vs \"Healthy\" threshold of ≥ 1.0\nThe quick ratio of 0.54 falls significantly below the 1.0 threshold for healthy liquidity, indicating that Verizon cannot cover its current liabilities with its most liquid assets.\n\nCONTEXT:\nThe quick ratio is highly relevant for measuring liquidity as it focuses on the most liquid current assets that can be quickly converted to cash to meet short-term obligations. For Verizon, this metric shows the company would need to rely on inventory conversion, operating cash flows, or external financing to meet current obligations, as liquid assets only cover 54% of current liabilities.\n\nSOURCE: VERIZON_2022_10K.md - Consolidated Balance Sheets (Page 56)",
