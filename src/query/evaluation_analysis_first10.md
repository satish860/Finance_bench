- **Expected:** "No, 0.96 needs improvement to touch 1x mark"
- **Actual:** "Yes, 0.95 reasonably healthy"

**Analysis:**

   - Need more consistent interpretation criteria for subjective judgments
   - Consider developing standardized thresholds for "healthy" vs "needs improvement"

2. **Calculation Precision**
   - Minor rounding differences in intermediate calculations
   - Could implement more precise decimal handling

## Cost Analysis

### Cost Distribution
- **Range:** $0.07 - $0.44 per question
- **Most Expensive:** Question #9 (Activision Blizzard, $0.44) - Complex multi-document search
- **Least Expensive:** Question #6 (3M, $0.07) - Single document, specific data point

### Cost Efficiency
- **$0.22 average** per question is reasonable for comprehensive financial analysis
- Projected cost for full 150 questions: ~$33 (close to actual $32.94)

## Recommendations

1. **Maintain Current Approach**
   - Numerical calculation methodology is excellent
   - Source citation format is comprehensive and helpful
   - Document search strategy is effective

2. **Improve Qualitative Assessments**
   - Develop standardized criteria for subjective evaluations
