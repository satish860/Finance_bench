However, the recent decline is heavily influenced by the pass-through nature of raw material costs (resins, film, chemicals, aluminum), which increases both revenue and cost of sales proportionally, mathematically compressing the gross margin percentage even when absolute profitability may be stable. AMCOR's business model includes contractual mechanisms to pass raw material cost increases to customers, which protects dollar profitability but impacts the margin percentage.",

The company uses **program accounting** for its commercial aircraft programs, where costs are accumulated over the entire production life of aircraft programs rather than individual units. This means:\n\n- Gross margins on programs like the 767, 777X, and 787 were at \"near break-even or single digit margins\" in FY2022\n- Large reach-forward losses (like the $3.5B charge on the 787 program in 2021) can severely distort gross margins in specific periods\n- The metric is highly sensitive to production rates, supply chain disruptions, certification delays, and customer negotiations\n\nThe improving trend reflects Boeing's recovery from the 737 MAX crisis and COVID-19 impacts, though margins remain thin compared to typical manufacturing industries.",

Let me read the 10K more carefully to find if there's an \"Adjusted EBIT\" metric or if I need to calculate it from Adjusted EBITDAR: \n\nI can see from the reconciliation table that MGM's Adjusted EBITDAR for 2022 is $3,497,254 thousand (shown in line 1290, though the actual number appears in line 1133). I also see the interest expense for 2022 is $594,954 thousand (line 1274).\n\nHowever, the question asks for \"Adjusted EBIT\" not \"Adjusted EBITDAR\". To calculate Adjusted EBIT, I need to subtract Depreciation and Amortization (and Rent) from Adjusted EBITDAR. Let me extract the specific values:\n\nFrom the reconciliation table (lines 1262-1290):\n- Adjusted EBITDAR for 2022: $3,497,254 thousand\n- Depreciation and amortization for 2022: $3,482,050 thousand (line 1281)\n- Triple-net operating lease and ground lease rent expense: $1,950,566 thousand (line 1287)\n- Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized for 2022: $594,954 thousand (line 1274)\n\nTo get Adjusted EBIT from Adjusted EBITDAR, I need to subtract Depreciation, Amortization, and Rent.\n\nAdjusted EBIT = Adjusted EBITDAR - Depreciation & Amortization - Rent\nAdjusted EBIT = $3,497,254 - $3,482,050 - $1,950,566 = -$1,935,362 thousand\n\nInterest Coverage Ratio = Adjusted EBIT / Interest Expense\nInterest Coverage Ratio = -$1,935,362 / $594,954 = -3.25\n\n**MGM's interest coverage ratio using FY2022 Adjusted EBIT as the numerator and annual Interest Expense as the denominator is approximately -3.25x.**\n\nNote: This is a negative ratio because Adjusted EBIT (after subtracting depreciation and rent from Adjusted EBITDAR) is negative. The company had Adjusted EBITDAR of $3.50 billion, but after accounting for $3.48 billion in depreciation/amortization and $1.95 billion in rent expense, the Adjusted EBIT is negative.",

      "question": "Does Verizon have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.",
      "expected_answer": "No. The quick ratio was approximately 0.54 for Verizon. It indicated that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile.",
      "actual_answer": "I'll help you assess Verizon's liquidity profile for FY 2022 using the quick ratio. Let me find and analyze the relevant financial data. \n\nPerfect! I found the balance sheet data. Now let me extract the specific components needed for the quick ratio calculation:\n\n- **Cash and cash equivalents (2022)**: $2,605 million\n- **Accounts receivable, net (2022)**: $24,506 million  \n- **Current liabilities (2022)**: $50,171 million\n\nNow let me check if there are any marketable securities: \n\nThe document mentions unrealized losses on marketable securities but doesn't list them as a separate line item in current assets. Let me calculate the quick ratio with the data I have: **No, Verizon does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022.**\n\nThe quick ratio is **0.54**, which means Verizon can only cover 54% of its current liabilities with its most liquid assets (cash and accounts receivable). \n\n**Calculation breakdown (all figures in millions):**\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $2,605\n- Accounts receivable, net: $24,506\n- **Total quick assets: $27,111**\n- Current liabilities: $50,171\n- **Quick ratio = 0.54**\n\n**Analysis:**\nA healthy quick ratio is typically 1.0 or higher, indicating a company can fully cover its short-term obligations with liquid assets. Verizon's ratio of 0.54 falls significantly below this threshold, suggesting potential liquidity concerns.\n\n**However, the quick ratio IS relevant for measuring liquidity** for most companies. It's a conservative measure that excludes inventory and other less-liquid current assets, focusing only on cash and near-cash assets. For a telecommunications company like Verizon, this is an appropriate metric since they don't carry significant inventory relative to their asset base (only $2,388M in inventory vs. $37,857M in total current assets).\n\nThat said, Verizon's low quick ratio should be considered in context: as a large, established telecom with stable cash flows ($37.1B operating cash flow in 2022) and access to capital markets, they may be able to manage their short-term obligations despite the low ratio.",
